## Languages

I like languages, always have. As everybody in Finland, I studied English and Swedish in school. I especially liked studying the grammar and deemed the etymology of words and phrases highly interesting. I have also regarded it important to develop a clear identity in both languages through a coherent accent and perfecting the pronunciation.

I remember vividly the first real-life situation I used English in communication: I was 14 and our high school had a class of students visiting from our twinning school located in NH, USA. We had to take turns and ask questions we had prepared beforehand from selected students and I was very nervous. In the end, all went well and I was even a little surprised how easy it was to communicate with a person from the other side of the world. The second time I had to put my English skills to the test was when we visited our distant relatives in Canada with my father. I had just turned 18 and had to be in charge of all interaction with the locals, a responsibility that felt thrilling back then but also that I highly cherish now. 

In high school, I quickly made friends with the many exchange students we had and still visit the ones that became my best friends periodically. When it comes to my work experience, I consider myself lucky. The jobs I've had since high school have all taken place in a multicultural environment. This has broadened my horizons and developed my confidence in communicating with different languages even further.

Concerning Swedish, I am a bit different from the rest given my big interest in the language and Nordic culture in general. I studied the basic level Swedish curriculum in school but have consistently tried to take every opportunity to use it and improve myself. I follow Nordic literature, news and media in the original language and went even so far that I wrote my [Master's Thesis](https://jarvijaakko.github.io/#reading--writing) of disparities in the Nordic countries' labor productivity that included some serious digging on the Nordic countries' Statistical bureaus' websites. Currently, I use Swedish daily while networking with my Nordic colleagues and through my relationship with a Finnish-Swedish girlfriend. Roughly half of my social gatherings are in Swedish.

My cousin, aunt and godfather have roots in Uruguay and are all bilingual in Finnish and Spanish. That has enabled me to hear and understand Spanish throughout my life. In high school, I thought it might be wise to take Spanish classes to be able to communicate with confidence. I continued studying Spanish in the University and quickly found myself applying for an exchange year in the University of Barcelona as a part of my Master's studies. I got accepted and spent the year using Spanish daily while running errands ranging from visiting hardware store to applying for the residence permit. In addition, I took Catalan classes and engaged in ad hoc conversations with the locals. The year was unique as I arrived in Barcelona a week after the terrorist attacks and right after it was time for the Catalan independence referendum and demonstrations associated to that.

I have also taken classes in Chinese and continuing the studies is something I have thought of. It would truly be an eye-opening experience to work in China for some time. I am intrigued by exotic languages and learning Arabic is next on my list.
