## Languages & Travel

I like languages, always have. As everybody in Finland, I studied English and Swedish in school. I especially liked studying the grammar and deemed the etymology of words and phrases highly interesting. I have also regarded it important to develop an identity in both languages through a coherent accent and perfecting the pronunciation. 

I remember vividly the first real-life situation I used English in communication: I was 14 and we had a class of students visiting from our twinning school located in NH, USA. We had to take turns and ask our pre-prepared questions from selected students and I was very nervous. In the end, all went well and I was even a little surprised how easy it was to communicate with a person from the other side of the world. The second time I had to put my English skills to the test was when we visited our distant relatives in Canada with my father. I had just turned 18 and had to be in charge of all interaction with the locals, a responsibility that felt scary back then but that I highly cherish now. Since high school I've been heavily involved with the vast exchange student community and still visit the ones that became my best friends almost annually. I consider myself lucky since the jobs I've had since high school have all taken place in a multicultural environment. This has broadened my horizons and developed my confidence in communicating with different languages even further.

Concerning Swedish, I am different of many other since I am ...

My cousin, aunt and godfather have roots in Uruguay and are bilingual (Finnish-Spanish). That has enabled me to hear and understand Spanish throughout my life. In high school, I thought it might be wise to take Spanish classes to  really liked was some more exotic languages strike a chord in me.
