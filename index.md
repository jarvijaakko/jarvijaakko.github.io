## About

This homepage is a diary-like collection of random stuff about my endeavours with the intention of drawing a comprehensive picture of my development, both professional and personal. Below, I have included a selection of activities that have played a part in making me the person I currently am.

## Languages

I like languages, always have. As everybody in Finland, I studied English and Swedish in school. I especially liked studying the grammar and deemed the etymology of words and phrases highly interesting. I have also regarded it important to develop a clear identity in both languages through a coherent accent and perfecting the pronunciation.

I remember vividly the first real-life situation I used English in communication: I was 14 and our high school had a class of students visiting from our twinning school located in NH, USA. We had to take turns and ask questions we had prepared beforehand from selected students and I was very nervous. In the end, all went well and I was even a little surprised how easy it was to communicate with a person from the other side of the world. The second time I had to put my English skills to the test was when we visited our distant relatives in Canada with my father. I had just turned 18 and had to be in charge of all interaction with the locals, a responsibility that felt thrilling back then but also that I highly cherish now. 

In high school, I quickly made friends with the many exchange students we had and still visit the ones that became my best friends periodically. When it comes to my work experience, I consider myself lucky. The jobs I've had since high school have all taken place in a multicultural environment. This has broadened my horizons and developed my confidence in communicating with different languages even further.

Concerning Swedish, I am a bit different from the rest given my big interest in the language and Nordic culture in general. I studied the basic level Swedish curriculum in school but have consistently tried to take every opportunity to use it and improve myself. I follow Nordic literature, news and media in the original language and went even so far that I wrote my [Master's Thesis](https://jarvijaakko.github.io/#reading--writing) of disparities in the Nordic countries' labor productivity that included some serious digging on the Nordic countries' Statistical bureaus' websites. Currently, I use Swedish daily while networking with my Nordic colleagues and through my relationship with a Finnish-Swedish girlfriend. Roughly half of my social gatherings are in Swedish.

My cousin, aunt and godfather have roots in Uruguay and are all bilingual in Finnish and Spanish. That has enabled me to hear and understand Spanish throughout my life. In high school, I thought it might be wise to take Spanish classes to be able to communicate with confidence. I continued studying Spanish in the University and quickly found myself applying for an exchange year in the University of Barcelona as a part of my Master's studies. I got accepted and spent the year using Spanish daily while running errands ranging from visiting hardware store to applying for the residence permit. In addition, I took Catalan classes and engaged in ad hoc conversations with the locals. The year was unique as I arrived in Barcelona a week after the terrorist attacks and right after it was time for the Catalan independence referendum and demonstrations associated to that.

I have also taken classes in Chinese and continuing the studies is something I have thought of. It would truly be an eye-opening experience to work in China for some time. I am intrigued by exotic languages and learning Arabic is next on my list.

## Travel

I like meeting new people and truly believe every conversation is a possibility to learn something valuable. Part of this is the neverending longing for new experiences in the form of traveling. The interest towards the vastness of different views of the world I picked from my social sciences background have drived me to some highly unusual destinations.

I've visited my relatives, living then in Argentina and Chile, and really felt connected with the local mentality there. In my opinion, the welcoming atmosphere that centers around the family is something Finnish people could learn from. Despite the political and economic tensions, most people seem to lead a happy and stable life and can value the free time as it should be valued. This is, of course, just my personal opinion concerning only the things I've seen. 

I've been lucky to have been able to visit Caribbean through a friend of mine who was studying in Cuba. During the trip, we stayed at a volunteer work center and took part in some of the activities also. This took place in the mountainous region of Dominican republic and taught me to better understand people living in rural areas without the amenities we take for granted. During the trip I also traveled to the Haitian side of the border and experienced things I will not easily forget. This was just five years after the massive Haitian earthquake and I got to feel the local pulse on many issues. We naturally also visited cuba, an experience that was particularly valuable to me as an Economics student. 

Some of the other experiences I've had was a spontaneous trip to Svalbard, a secluded group of islands belonging to Norway. As the region is located roughly halfway between the northernmost point in Scandinavia and the North pole, I got exposed to the vastness of untamed nature and harsh nature by e.g. crawling in a cave under the glacier. 

I've also witnessed the endangered silverback mountain gorillas by standing one meter apart in the jungle of Uganda and visited Rwanda and Kenya to see the true state of African prosperity. Some other trips I've made have been set in South-East Asia and West-Africa, more on them in the [Reading & Writing](https://jarvijaakko.github.io/#reading--writing) section.

## Reading & Writing

Reading interests

Published (links) and nonpublished (link to LinkedIn) writing.

During my first independent travels I picked up a habit of writing a travel blog to practice my writing. Blogs about my [first trip](https://filppumenoa.blogspot.com/) to the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia and the [second trip](https://maailmankiertue2014.blogspot.com/) to Thailand, Cambodia, Lao and Vietnam express well my development as a writer and an observer. I regard these texts as products of the time and cannot fully stand behind them but feel the advantages in self-critique too strong to let them unnoticed. The [travel blog](https://wordpress.com/view/jaakkojasarvikuonot.wordpress.com) I feel best depicts my skills and wits is the one I wrote during my trip to Benin and Togo in West-Africa. Writing the texts was a peaceful process and I also possessed some more understanding of the world around me. This is the one I've also gotten most feedback and have been able to turn it into my advantage.
